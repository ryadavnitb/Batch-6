# 🌍 EnviroScan: AI-Powered Pollution Source Identifier

EnviroScan is an AI-driven decision-support system that predicts the **dominant source of air pollution** at a location (industrial, vehicular, agricultural burning, residential burning, or natural) using ambient air-quality data, weather conditions, and geospatial context. It helps authorities and urban planners move from basic concentration monitoring to **actionable, source-aware insights** for targeted interventions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional monitoring networks report pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, etc.) but rarely indicate *why* the air is polluted at a given time and place. EnviroScan combines: 

- Historical and live air-quality measurements  
- Weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and pressure  
- Geospatial features from OpenStreetMap (roads, industries, agricultural fields, dump sites, and distances to them)  

A trained machine learning model uses these inputs to predict the **dominant pollution source**, visualize hotspots on a map, and support alerting and reporting workflows.

## ✨ Key Features
### Source classification
- Predicts the dominant pollution source class for each record using an XGBoost classifier trained on air-quality, weather, and OSM-based features. 

### Geospatial hotspot mapping
- Embeds an interactive pollution map (EnviroScan/enviro_scan_pollution_map.html) to explore spatial patterns, hotspots, and source risk across locations. 

### Real-time data integration
- Fetches live pollution and weather data from the OpenWeather Air Pollution and Current Weather APIs given coordinates or city selections. 

### Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Offers city selection, coordinate input, or location search, visual summaries (metrics, bar charts, gauges, radar charts, pies), and alert messages based on AQI. 

### Threshold-based alerts
- Displays GOOD / MODERATE / UNHEALTHY alert banners depending on the predicted or live AQI value. 
### Automated reporting
- Exports CSV, Excel, and PDF reports with charts (bar, pie, radar, gauge) and key metrics using Plotly and FPDF.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
### Target variable:
- Dominant source – categorical label representing the most likely pollution source for each observation. 

### Input features (examples): 

- Air-quality metrics: SO2, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, AQI.

- Weather variables: Temperature C, Humidity, Pressure hPa.

- Geospatial / OSM features: distances (distnearestroadm, distnearestindm, distnearestdumpm, distnearestagrim).

### Model pipeline:

- Preprocessing: handling missing values, cleaning pollutant and AQI fields, feature engineering, scaling/encoding where required. 

- Model: XGBoost classifier trained on the processed dataset and saved as xgb_pollution_source.joblib. 

- Label encoder: maps numeric class indices back to human-readable source labels and is stored as label_encoder.joblib. 

### Predictions in the app:

- Builds a feature vector from live API data or historical records.

- Returns predicted label, confidence score (max class probability), and full probability distribution for visualization and PDF export.

## 📦 Installation and Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryadavnitb/Batch-6.git
cd Batch-6

# Switch to your branch
git checkout Mahek

# Go into the EnviroScan project folder
cd EnviroScan
```
### 2️⃣ Create and Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate
```
### 3️⃣ Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs all required packages for the notebook and app.py (Streamlit, XGBoost, geospatial libs, Plotly, FPDF, etc.).
### 4️⃣ Configure OpenWeather API Key
In app.py, set your OpenWeather key:
- OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "PUT_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
### 5️⃣ Run the EnviroScan Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
- Then open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501) to use the EnviroScan app.
---
### From the UI you can:

- Select a city, enter coordinates, or search a location.

- Fetch live pollution and weather features for that point.

- Get the predicted dominant pollution source with confidence.

- View visual summaries (metrics, bar charts, gauge, radar, pie, trends).

- Explore the embedded geospatial pollution map.

- Download CSV, Excel, and PDF reports for the selected city or live location.

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Integrate continuous streaming of sensor data instead of on-demand API calls.

- Add SHAP or similar explainability tools directly into the dashboard for per-prediction explanations.

- Containerize the application with Docker for smoother deployment.

- Extend the model to more cities, pollutants, and finer-grained source categories.
